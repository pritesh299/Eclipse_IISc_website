        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-4 display-7">Eclipse, the premier undergraduate sports fest of IISc, was born with a singular purpose: to encourage students to step out of their academic routines and embrace an active, sports-driven lifestyle. With the demanding nature of undergraduate studies, it's easy for students to slip into sedentary habits, spending much of their time confined within their hostels. Eclipse aims to break this cycle by creating a vibrant atmosphere that draws students into the arena of sports, helping them discover the joy of physical activity, competition, and camaraderie. It's more than just a sports fest; it's a celebration of college life and a platform to foster unity and spirit within each batch.<br><br>At the core of Eclipse lies its vision to push boundaries, not just in sports but in organizing, teamwork, and community spirit. Each new season embodies the ambition to surpass the efforts, standards, and goals set by the previous one. The motto of Eclipse is to "Eclipse" ourselves â€“ constantly striving to elevate the fest to new heights and create unforgettable experiences with every edition.<br><br><strong>History</strong><br>Eclipse took shape in 2022, conceived by the passionate and sports-loving batch of 2018, who aimed to instill a tradition of annual sports fests in the IISc UG community. They organized the inaugural edition of Eclipse, laying the foundation for what has now become a much-anticipated event in the undergraduate calendar.<br><br>The fest has since grown in both scale and enthusiasm, with each new edition building on the successes of its predecessors. After the resounding success of Season 1 in 2022, the fest continued with Seasons 2 and 3 in 2023 and 2024, respectively, with bigger turnouts and even more diverse sports events.<br><br><strong>Past Winners</strong><br>Eclipse has seen fierce competition and sportsmanship since its inception. In the first season, it was the batch of 2017 that claimed the championship, setting a high bar for future contenders. Season 2, held in 2023, saw the batch of 2018 emerge victorious, proudly claiming the title for their efforts. Currently, the reigning champions are the batch of 2021, who triumphed in Season 3 of Eclipse in 2024. As each new season approaches, the excitement builds, with each batch vying for the honor of taking home the title.<br><br>With its vibrant energy, competitive spirit, and inclusive ethos, Eclipse continues to inspire undergraduates to come together, celebrate sports, and create lasting memories that define their time at IISc.</p>
